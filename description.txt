Ever wished there were more multiclass armor options in Terraria? Sick of waiting for Sandstorms to be able to get Forbidden armor? Wished Hardmode Ore Armors were more interesting? 

More Multiclass aims to add more options for playing multiclass, with a focus on interesting armor abilities that encourage novel play styles.
